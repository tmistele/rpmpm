Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

This is the next test [^2] and [^secondlongnote]

[^2]: Another small footnote
[^secondlongnote]: Followed without blank line

    by multiline note

and another paragraph that doesn't belong to the footnote.
